    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. Thre are size levels of headings.</p>
  </body>

  <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
  <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered lists)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li><p>They don't need to be in any particular order</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
  <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>You should also be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> draw attention to a particular word phrase.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Sometimes, you need to shout! </strong></em></p>

  <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
  <p>We are going to
    enter here but
    nothing will change</p>

    <p>But, <br/>
      this will! </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>We just inserted a horizontal rule</p>
